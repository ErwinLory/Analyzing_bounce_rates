# SQL_Analyzing_bounce_rates
Bounced rate is a proportion of visitors who come to our website, then just leave without opening another page or interacting with it. In this project, I analyze bounced in home page to see to see how many visitors only see the home page and immediately leave our website. this dataset is from maven analytics website.
